# Pre-push Hook

The `pre-push` hook is a Git hook that is executed before the `git push` command. This hook is used to update the `shared-data` submodule to the latest commit before pushing changes to the remote repository.

## code
```bs
#!/bin/bash

echo "Pushing changes in the submodule..."

# Navigate to the submodule directory
cd shared-data

# Check the status of the submodule
git status

# Add all changes to the staging area
git add .

# Create a commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Update submodule by backend"

# Push the changes to the remote repository
git push origin master

# Return to the parent directory
cd ..
```

## Purpose

The purpose of the `pre-push` hook is to ensure that any changes made to the `shared-data` submodule are pushed to the remote repository along with the changes in the parent repository.

## Usage

When `git push` is run, the `pre-push` hook script is automatically executed. It performs the following actions:

1.  Navigates to the `shared-data` submodule directory.
2.  Checks the status of the submodule.
3.  Adds all changes to the staging area.
4.  Creates a commit with a descriptive message.
5.  Pushes the changes to the remote repository.
6.  Returns to the parent directory.

## Configuration

To enable the `pre-push` hook, follow these steps:

1.  Create a file named `pre-push` in the `.git/hooks` directory of your repository.
2.  Add the script provided in the previous response to the `pre-push` file.
3.  Save the file and make it executable using the command `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push`.

Now, whenever you run `git push`, the `pre-push` hook will update the `shared-data` submodule before pushing changes to the remote repository.
